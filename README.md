# CS50 Web – Project 0: Search

This project is part of Harvard's CS50 Web Programming course.

The goal was to recreate Google's Search, Image Search, and Advanced Search pages using HTML and CSS, without using any frontend frameworks.

## Features

- Google Search page with functional search form
- Image Search using `tbm=isch`
- Advanced Search with:
  - all words (`as_q`)
  - exact phrase (`as_epq`)
  - any words (`as_oq`)
  - none of these words (`as_eq`)
- Basic responsive layout
- Clean and simple CSS styling

## What I Practiced

- Structuring HTML forms
- Understanding GET parameters
- Working with query strings
- CSS layout using flexbox and grid
- Matching real-world UI structure

## Notes

This is an early project in my web development journey.  
The focus was on understanding how forms communicate with backend services and how layout structure works.

More advanced styling and JavaScript functionality will be added in future projects.
